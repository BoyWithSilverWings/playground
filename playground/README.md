## Notice:

Modified from `@agney/playground`, mainly to add config [interactive](https://github.com/agneym/playground/issues/38), because the original author has not merged this [PR](https://github.com/agneym/playground/pull/39) for the time being, so I established my own repository. If you don't need this feature, please move to the original repository [playground](https://github.com/agneym/playground).Thanks to the original author.
